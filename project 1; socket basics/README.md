# Project 1: Socket Basics

## Description
This assignment was intended to help familiarize us to writing simpler network
code. A client program is implemented to play a variation of the game "Wordle".
The client makes guesses for the secret word and receives feedback information
about how close the guess is. When the client guesses the word, the server
returns a "secret flag" message.

The program utilizes Python language, and the following libraries that are a
part of the python standard library: socket,
argparse, ssl, json, and random.

As an Align MSCS student with no background knowledge in network programming, the biggest challenges encountered during this project
was self-teaching and reading over the documentation to learn about socket
basics.

As such, the following resources were referenced during the implementation of
this project:

> https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html
> https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#the-parse-args-method
> https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/a-complete-guide-to-socket-programming-in-python
> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/open-a-file-in-python/#
> https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html
> https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html
> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/enumerate-in-python/

## How to Install & Run Program

## How to Use the Program
The client program is designed to pull from a provided list of words to use as
word guesses. After running the script to start the program and connecting to
the server at `proj1.3700.network`, the program will play out the game without
any user input.
