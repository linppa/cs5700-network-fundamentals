## How to install & run:
- 

- Rather than testing our on a real network, we are testing it in a simulator
  implemented in a script named `run`. The simulator comes with a suite of
  configuration files in the `configs` directory that our router is able to
  handle. To run the simulator, the following command is used:

> `$ ./run [config-file]`

- Otherwise, the router can be test with the entire test suite by running the
  following command to run the `test` file:

> `$ ./test`
